            <p id="game">My playstation is one of my most prized possessions. The value of this console may be declining the sentimental meaning this device 
                has to me is immense. I've spent hours staring intently at the illustrations this machine provides. Playstation 
                has been very consistent in my life and how I spend my time. I've made several friends through my gaming habits.

            <p>Mortal Kombat is a video game franchise originally developed by Midway Games' Chicago studio in 1992. The development of the first
            game was originally based on an idea that Ed Boon and John Tobias had of making a video game starring Jean-Claude Van Damme, but as that idea fell through,
            a horror-fantasy themed fighting game titled Mortal Kombat was created instead. The original game has spawned many sequels and spin-offs consisting of several 
            action-adventure games, films (animated and live-action with its own sequel), and television series (animated and live-action), as well as a comic book series, a
            card game and a live-action tour. Along with Street Fighter and Tekken, Mortal Kombat has become one of the most successful fighting franchises in the history of 
            video games and one of the highest-grossing media franchises of all time.</p>

            <p class="fun">Call of Duty is a first-person shooter video game franchise. Starting out in 2003, it first focused on games set in World War II, but over 
                time, the series has seen games set in modern times, the midst of the Cold War, futuristic worlds, and outer space. Infinity Ward was the series' 
                first developer, with Treyarch later becoming the second, creating a two-team development cycle. Sledgehammer Games later became the third developer 
                in the cycle. Activision has served as the publisher for the series since its creation. Several spin-offs and handheld versions of titles have also 
                been made by other developers. The most recent title, Call of Duty: Black Ops 4, was released on October 12, 2018.The series originally focused on the 
                World War II setting, with Infinity Ward developing the first (2003) and second (2005) titles in the series and Treyarch developing the third (2006). 
                Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare (2007) introduced a new, modern setting, and proved to be the breakthrough title for the series, creating the Modern Warfare 
                sub-series. The game's legacy also influenced the creation of a remastered version, released in 2016. Two other entries, Modern Warfare 2 (2009) and 3 (2011), 
                were made. Infinity Ward have also developed two games outside of the Modern Warfare sub-series, Ghosts (2013) and Infinite Warfare (2016). Treyarch made one 
                last World War II-based game, World at War (2008), before releasing Black Ops (2010) and subsequently creating the Black Ops sub-series. Three other entries, 
                Black Ops II (2012), III (2015), and 4 (2018), were made. Sledgehammer Games, who were co-developers for Modern Warfare 3, have also developed two titles, 
                Advanced Warfare (2014) and WWII (2017).As of February 2016, the series has sold over 250 million copies.[1] Sales of all Call of Duty games topped US$15 billion.
                Other products in the franchise include a line of action figures designed by Plan-B Toys, a card game created by Upper Deck Company, Mega bloks sets by Mega 
                Brands, and a comic book mini-series published by WildStorm Productions.</p>
